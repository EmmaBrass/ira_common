# Need a pic of a canvas before and after human marks

# Then run these with the correct methods in arm_movements (with connection to robot)
# to see how well they work

# Bring in some paper and more brushes and some more paint colors tomorrow.

# I think at the moment the canvas initialisation is failing, but maybe that is just because I haven't put a canvas down.

# Start by writing the test and then testing with no canvas.
# Then test with canvas.

# Figure out how to get failues in this lower-down code to show up in the higher code!
